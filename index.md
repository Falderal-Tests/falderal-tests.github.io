## Falderal Literate Tests

The aim of the Falderal Tests project is to provide [Falderal][]
literate tests suites for common programming languages.
It is primarily intended for

*   people who want to learn a programming language (and who like reading lots of small examples);
*   people implementing a programming language, who want to see how conformant their implementation is;
*   people comparing multiple implementations of the same programming language, to understand how they differ.

The following properties of Falderal tests make them suited for the above purposes:

*   are meant to be readable by humans;
*   are meant to be executed by machines;
*   are implementation-independent â€” they test functionalities, not particular tools.
